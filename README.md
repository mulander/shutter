Python + twisted jsonrpc webservice for taking snapshot renderings of web pages

purpose
=======
The purpose of the application is to purely serve as an example for an article I'm writing.

Main point of the article is to demonstrate how to write webservices using twisted, how to handle blocking calls,
test applications using twisted etc.

Rendering of the website will be performed using [python-webkit2png](https://github.com/AdamN/python-webkit2png) which will be just invoked as a script from the main application upon request.

The article will be written in Polish and not part of the repository though the comments and documentation of the code will be written in English.
I might translate the article to english some time after it's published though don't take my word on that.
